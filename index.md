This page is a showcases my current coding projects and allows viewers and to demonstrate proficiency with various languages and coding concepts.  

Initially, I conducted a code review for three artifacts produced in classes taken toward my computer science degree.  The main purpose of the review was to ensure readable and maintainable code.  The review focused on software engineering concepts used within the code as well as following programming guideline and security best practices within the code.  The videos of those reviews can be accessed below:

- Initial [review of Software Design and Engineering Artifact](url).
- Initial [review of Algorithm and Data Strtuctures Artifact](url).
- Initial [review of Database Artifact](url).

The first artifact is a business solution menu demonstrating proficiency in Java program development.  The program employs loops, branches, object-oriented programming principles, and appropriate data structures to solve a sample buisiness problem.  The enhancement to the artifact demonstrates the ability to take a potential user story requesting new application functionality and implement it using good software engineering skills.  This supports creating computing solutions that solve a given problem using computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution.  This also demonstrates an understanding of techniques, skills, and tools used in implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
