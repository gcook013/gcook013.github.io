##This page is a showcases my current coding projects and allows viewers and to demonstrate proficiency with various languages and coding concepts.  

Initially, I conducted a code review for three artifacts produced in classes taken toward my computer science degree. The main purpose of the review was to ensure readable and maintainable code. The review focused on software engineering concepts used within the code as well as following programming guideline and security best practices within the code. The videos of those reviews can be accessed below:

- Initial [review of Software Design and Engineering Artifact](https://github.com/gcook013/gcook013.github.io/blob/main/code_review/Software%20Design%20Code%20Review.mp4).
- Initial [review of Algorithm and Data Strtuctures Artifact](https://github.com/gcook013/gcook013.github.io/blob/main/code_review/Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structure%20Code%20Review.mp4).
- Initial [review of Database Artifact](https://github.com/gcook013/gcook013.github.io/blob/main/code_review/Database%20Code%20Review.mp4).

The first artifact is a business solution menu demonstrating proficiency in Java program development. The program employs loops, branches, object-oriented programming principles, and appropriate data structures to solve a sample buisiness problem by allowing the user to add, edit, and remove information from arrays. The application also uses appropriate exception catching for user input.  The enhancement to the artifact demonstrates the ability to take a potential user story requesting new application functionality and implement it using good software engineering skills. This supports creating computing solutions that solve a given problem using computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution. This also demonstrates an understanding of techniques, skills, and tools used in implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.

The second artifact is a business solution menu demonstrating proficiency in C++ program development. This program also employs loops, branches, appropriate data structures, and search algorithms to solve a sample buisiness problem by allowing both linear and binary searches as well as inserting, editing, and removing nodes from linked lists. The enhancement to the artifact highlights the performance gain using binary search algorithms on sorted lists and linear search algorithms on unsorted lists. Additionally, this program employs custom header files to parse CSV formatted input to load into nodes for manipulation. The application uses principles of recursion when creating the binary tree as it traversedseach branch to determine the correct placement of nodes based on their data. This shows how an application can solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices.

The third artifact is a database application that started with a python script that incorporated the basic database operations create, read, update, and delete.  The script was initially deployed in a jupyter notebook, but this didn't allow for much user interaction and all operations were hardcoded in the script.  The basic python script demonstrates an understanding of the fundamental database methods and how data is manipulated. It is based on MongoDB, a NoSQL database system and connects to an existing database which can be edited. I originally intended to enhance this artifact by coding HTML and JavaScript to call the python script. In my efforts to enhance the artifact, I instead used the Flask framework for Python to code the functionality of the script with custom HTML forms and CSS. This involved the conversion of HTML input fields into dictionary/JSON objects that could be passed to a MongoDB database to execute the core functions of the original Python script. After completing the script functions, the results are then passed back to the webpage using Jinja templating. This process demonstrates an understanding of the fundamentals of taking existing scripts and creating requests to that code through an HTML interface. This reinforces how users need to interact with scripts when working with underlfying applications that manipulate databases. This enhancement exemplifies computer solutions that deliver value using well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices specifically displaying proficiency with Python, HTML, and CSS.
