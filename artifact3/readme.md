For my Databases artifact, I started with a python script that implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete methods for an existing database.  This artifact was introduced and developed in the course CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts using the Python programming language. This artifact demonstrates an understanding of the fundamental database methods and how data is manipulated.  This artifact is based on MongoDB, a NoSQL database system.  I intend to enhance this artifact by coding HTML and JavaScript to call the python script.  In my efforts to enhance the artifact, I instead used the Flask framework for Python to code the functionality of the script with custom HTML forms and CSS.  This involved the conversion of HTML input fields into dictionary/JSON objects that could be passed to a MongoDB database to execute the core functions of the original Python script.  After completing the script functions, the results were then passed back to the webpage using Jinja templating.  This will demonstrate an understanding of the fundamentals of taking existing scripts and creating requests to that code through an HTML interface.  This will reinforce how users need to interact with scripts when working with underlying applications that manipulate databases.  This enhancement exemplifies computer solutions that deliver value using well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices specifically displaying proficiency with Python, HTML, and CSS.
